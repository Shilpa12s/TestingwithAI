# TestingwithAI


# 🧪 AI in Software Quality Assurance

This repository showcases my experiments and projects in applying **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to **Software Quality Assurance (SQA)**.
The goal is to explore how AI can make testing smarter, faster, and more reliable.

## 📂 Projects in this Repository

### 1. 🤖 AI Test Case Generator

* **Description:** Uses LLMs (like ChatGPT / OpenAI API) to generate test cases from requirements in natural language.
* **Tech:** Python, OpenAI API.
* **Demo:** Converts login requirements into 10+ functional & negative test cases in Gherkin format.

---

### 2. 🔧 Self-Healing Selenium Tests

* **Description:** Automated tests that heal themselves when locators change using **Healenium**.
* **Tech:** Java/Python + Selenium + Healenium.
* **Demo App:** [DemoQA](https://demoqa.com).

---

### 3. 👀 Visual Testing with AI

* **Description:** Detects visual UI changes that traditional automation misses.
* **Tech:** Applitools Eyes (free tier).
* **Demo App:** [The Internet App](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com).

---

### 4. 🐞 Defect Severity Prediction (ML Project)

* **Description:** Trains an ML model to classify defect severity (High / Medium / Low) from bug report data.
* **Tech:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook.
* **Dataset:** Public bug report dataset from Kaggle.

---

### 5. 📊 AI Log Analysis with ReportPortal

* **Description:** Uses **ReportPortal** to analyze test logs and group failures using AI clustering.
* **Tech:** ReportPortal (open-source).
* **Demo:** Logs from automated API tests on [Swagger Petstore](https://petstore.swagger.io).
